    "This Additive Manufacturing data collection includes records related to a variety of additive manufacturing efforts at NIST.  It includes data related to techniques such as laser powder bed fusion, directed energy deposition, vat photopolymerization, and material extrusion.  A number of characterization and analysis methods are represented, as are datasets related to additive manufacturing process control and systems.  Various material systems are included such as metal alloys, polymers, and biomaterials.  Some of the datasets are used in model development and validation or as benchmarks."
